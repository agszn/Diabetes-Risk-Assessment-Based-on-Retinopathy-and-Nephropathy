
Diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy are two common complications of diabetes. Detection of these conditions typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and specialized tests. Here are the parameters commonly used to detect them:

Diabetic Retinopathy Detection:

Fundoscopic Examination: Direct examination of the retina using an ophthalmoscope to detect abnormalities such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates, and neovascularization.
Visual Acuity Testing: Assessing the sharpness of vision to detect any vision changes.
Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): Provides detailed images of the retina to detect swelling or thinning of retinal layers.
Fluorescein Angiography: Uses a fluorescent dye injected into the bloodstream to highlight blood vessels in the retina, identifying areas of leakage and abnormal blood vessel growth.
Retinal Photography: Capturing images of the retina to document changes over time and monitor progression.
Diabetic Nephropathy Detection:

Urine Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (ACR): A urine test measuring the ratio of albumin to creatinine to detect early signs of kidney damage.
Serum Creatinine Test: Measures the level of creatinine in the blood, indicating how well the kidneys are filtering waste products.
Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): Calculated from serum creatinine levels, providing an estimate of kidney function.
Blood Pressure Monitoring: High blood pressure can exacerbate kidney damage, so regular monitoring is crucial.
Kidney Biopsy: In more advanced cases, a small sample of kidney tissue may be taken for examination under a microscope to assess the extent of damage.
